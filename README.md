# hail-size-calculation
This repository contains all scripts used to calculate hydrometeor particles, with a focus on hailstones. The scripts accompany the article Sari &amp; Lasher-Trapp (2025).

Maximum hail diameter is defined either at the first model level (HMAXK1) or throughout the vertical column (HMAX2D), consistent with the calculations in the WRF model. For other hydrometeors, particle size is estimated using a gamma distribution based on mixing ratio and number concentration, following the resolution of the model grid points.
